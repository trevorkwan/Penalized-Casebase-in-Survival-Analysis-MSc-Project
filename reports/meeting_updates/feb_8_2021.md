# Notes for Penalized Casebase Project

## February 8, 2021

Dave has an interesting dataset (the EPIC dataset) in mind to apply the `casebase` method. In particular it's about variable selection. The current release of the [`casebase`](sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase) package has an option to perform variable selection on a survival dataset using the L1 penalty. It has not been thoroughly tested, and a simulation study comparing it to [`Coxnet`](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/articles/Coxnet.html) still needs to be done. 

So the project could be as simple as applying the existing casebase method on the EPIC dataset. A more comprehensive project would be to:  

1. Potentially extend the casebase method to incorporate SCAD/MCP penalties. This would be more of an implementation/programming task than a theoretical one.  
2. Perform simulation study comparing the performance of casebase with other methods that do variable selection on survival data.    
3. Apply casebase method on the EPIC dataset.  

The dataset is publicly available, and Dave has worked closely with it enough to understand the study design and biological questions.
