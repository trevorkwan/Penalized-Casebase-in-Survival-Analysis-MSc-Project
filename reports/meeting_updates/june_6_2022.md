Next Steps:
-	Stay with this simulation strategy, understand exactly why the generating function is this way (set.seeds, have many estimates/concordance measures, do it many times, many seeds, how many simulation runs are you considering, you are very strong computationally)
-	Double check the concordance is functioning the same way it is
-	Look for measurements for variable selection
-	Try to add another penalty function (SCAD) (will take more time)

-	Try to put something together, if you need to present the results of this simulation study, how will you do it (write a script including everything you have now, store the results in an effective way and visualize the results, R Markdown mini report)
1.	Understand all the pieces of the report that you are simulating/generating (model, method, metrics)
2.	Create a mini-report
3.	Add some variable selection performance measurements
a.	True positive is when the true coefficient is non-zero and lasso gives nonzero
b.	True negative is when the true coefficient is zero and lasso gives zero
c.	False negative is when the true coefficient is non-zero but lasso gives zero
d.	False positive is when the true coefficient is zero and lasso gives nonzero
e.	Negative = zero, positive = nonzero
f.	Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), combines all the measurements: true positive, false negative, etc.
