Next Steps:
-	Take away meeting updates from main README and transfer to reports. And put in the literature review papers so Gaby can read.
-	Read about casebase and implement it.
-	Try to figure out Brier score coding.

Questions:
-	How do you get the Brier Scores from glmnet? You can get it from coxph with the “Score Riskreg” function, and with coxph with the “predict(type = expected)” with the survival probabilities, but I can’t get the probabilities from a glmnet cox.
o	Because Cox was not made to predict survival probabilities. 
o	Previously in draft 4 of casebase_sim_study, and used in the SUPPORT study in the paper, they fit glmnet to see which variables to select for lasso, then fit a coxph using the selected variables in order to get the brier scores.
-	Why does predict in casebase ask me for 21 variables when I have 20 X’s?
o	I need the predicted risk scores/probs for casebase to get the concordance for cb
