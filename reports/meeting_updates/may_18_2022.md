Next Steps:
-	Figure out concordance, mathematical explanation (predict function for pen_cox and pen_cb can get concordance)
-	Generate one big dataset and split into train and test (to correct for correlation between them)
-	Explore non-convex penalties (ncbreg package, another package with SCAD)
-	Understand why the data were generated this way
-	Summarize the project in a README file (summary, how itâ€™s progressiong, team names, contact, also add a progress report in github)
-	Find some measure of goodness of variable selection (selection rate)
-	Explore other metrics for evaluation (Brier score, IPA, time-dependent ROC AUC)
-	Do the pen_cox method with glmnet (explore init, max_iter)
